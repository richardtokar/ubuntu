  <h1>Baseball</h1>

  <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each. The goal of the game is to score more runs than the other team by hitting a ball with a bat and running around the bases. The game is played on a diamond-shaped field with four bases at each corner. The batter tries to hit the ball and run around the bases, while the fielders try to catch the ball or tag the runner out.</p>
