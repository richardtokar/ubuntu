  <h1>Fortnite</h1>
  <p>Fortnite is a battle royale game developed by Epic Games. It was released in 2017 and has since become one of the most popular games in the world. The game is free to play, but players can purchase in-game items such as cosmetics and characters.</p>
  <p>In Fortnite, players are dropped onto an island with 99 other players. The goal of the game is to be the last player standing. Players can eliminate other players by shooting them with weapons or by building structures to trap them.
